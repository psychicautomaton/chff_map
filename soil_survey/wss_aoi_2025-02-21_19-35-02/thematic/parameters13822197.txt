SdvAttributeDescription: "Soil moisture subclasses are taxonomic subgroup criteria, whether included or not in the name of the subgroup.  The definition of each moisture subclass is dependent upon the specific taxonomic great group to which it is attached.

A taxonomic moisture subclass that is not ""typic"" reflects a taxonomic intergrade or extragrade.  Some soils having a particular moisture regime are transitional to another regime (intergrades) or are grading away from the regime to which they are assigned (extragrades).  An example of an intergrade is an Aquic Haplustalf.  The taxonomic moisture subclass is ""aquic"".  An example of an extragrade is an Aeric Albaqualf.  The taxonomic moisture subclass is ""aeric"".
