"NY047"|5|"BPL"|"Buried pavement layer"|A horizontal manufactured layer constructed by humans and buried beneath human-transported soil material within 24 inches of the soil surface. Examples include asphalt and concrete. Manufactured layers may act as liners (restricting root and water movement) and affect the water holding capacity and the depth class (as does an ortstein or similar cemented subsurface layer).Typically 0.5 to 1.4 acres.|"281312"
"NY047"|5|"COA"|"Coal ash dump"|An area of accumulated coal combustion by-products primarily sourced from past coal burning furnaces. These deposits can be at or above the neighboring ground level and are often concealed beneath a mantle of fill and vegetative cover. Typically 0.5 to 1.4 acres.|"281313"
"NY047"|5|"ESA"|"Anthropogenic escarpment"|A relatively continuous and steep slope or cliff, which is constructed by humans, that breaks the continuity of more gently sloping land surfaces. Exposed material is nonsoil, for example rubble or blasted bedrock, or steep soil banks.Typically 0.5 to 1.4 acres.|"281314"
"NY047"|5|"MAR"|"Marsh or swamp"|A water saturated, very poorly drained area that is intermittently or permanently covered by water. Sedges, cattails, and rushes are the dominate vegetation in marshes, and trees or shrubs are the dominant vegetation in swamps. Not used in map units where the named soils are poorly drained or very poorly drained. Typically 0.5 to 1.4 acres.|"281315"
"NY047"|5|"SLP"|"Short, steep slope"|A narrow area of soil having slopes that are at least two slope classes steeper than the slope class of the surrounding map unit.|"281316"
"NY047"|5|"SPO"|"Spoil area"|A pile of earthy materials, either smoothed or uneven, resulting from human activity. Typically 0.5 to 1.4 acres.|"281317"
"NY047"|5|"WAT"|"Perennial water"|Small, natural or constructed lakes, ponds, or pits that contain water most of the year. Typically 0.5 to 1.4 acres. |"281318"
"NY047"|5|"WET"|"Wet spot"|A somewhat poorly drained to very poorly drained area that is at least two drainage classes wetter than the named soils in the surrounding map unit. Typically 0.5 to 1.4 acres.|"281319"
